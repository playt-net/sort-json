# Sort JSON

This is a small CLI to sort any specified json files alphabetically.
This was created to sort localization files, but maybe you will find another use case.

## Installation

`npm install @playt/sort-json --save-dev`

## Usage

Check if json in folder is sorted:

`npx sort-json <folder>`

Check if file is sorted:

`npx sort-json <path-to-file>`

You can also fix these files instead of just checking.

`npx sort-json <folder or path-to-file> --fix`
